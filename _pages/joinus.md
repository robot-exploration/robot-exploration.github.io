</div>

See below for how to reach out if you are interested in working with REL. I
welcome inquiries from prospective PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and
University of Michigan undergraduate students.

To make sure I see your email, please make the subject line of your
email should follow the format
`"[Important] Prospective UMich <Position>"`.
For example, if you are a prospective PhD student, the subject line should be
`"[Important] Prospective UMich PhD Student"`.

Send your email to: apapalia [at] umich [dot] edu

## Prospective PhD Students

If you are interested in a PhD in this lab, reach out with a short email with
your CV and a brief 1-2 paragraphs on what you are interested in working on and
why this lab interests you (any relevant experience is useful to highlight).

We are looking for students who are excited to advance the state of the art in
robotics and to tackle difficult fundamental problems in localization,
perception, state estimation, and autonomous exploration and environmental
monitoring of the environment.

I would like to refer you to my [Lab
Philosophy](https://alanpapalia.github.io/blog/2025/advising-philosophy/) as
something that is good to read before reaching out. It's helpful if you can
indicate that you've read this in your email (along with any thoughts or
questions you may have).

## Current University of Michigan Undergraduates

I prefer undergraduate researchers who are available for *full-time
research* in the coming summer.

**Still interested?** Please send:
- A brief email confirming your full-time availability for the coming summer
- Your resume
- Your (unofficial) transcript
- Two short paragraphs explaining why you want to get involved

## Postdoctoral Researchers

While we are not currently looking for postdoctoral researchers, if you feel you
are a particularly good fit for the lab, please reach out with your CV, three
representative publications, and a brief description of your research interests
and how they align with the lab's work.
