# Welcome!

Welcome to the Robotics Exploration Lab (REL) at the University of Michigan!

We are a research group focused on developing algorithms and systems that enable
robots to explore and monitor challenging environments, with a particular focus
on underwater environments. Our work combines elements of robotics, computer
science, and engineering to build more capable autonomous systems that
allow us to better understand and interact with the natural world.

There are currently three main research areas in the lab:
- **Robotic Exploration and Adaptive Sampling** -- developing algorithms that
  allow robots to intelligently explore and sample their environment, choosing
  the most informative paths and measurements to maximize the information
  gained.
- **Low-Cost, Long-Term Autonomy** -- building cost-scalable systems that can
  operate independently for long periods of time in challenging conditions, such
  as underwater or in remote environments.
- **Robust, Reliable Perception and Localization** -- developing algorithms that
  allow robots to accurately perceive their environments and localize themselves
  in the presence of noise, outliers, and dynamic changes in the environment.

Past research in the lab has been recognized with awards such as the <a
href="https://www.ieee-ras.org/transactions-on-robotics-king-sun-fu-best-paper-award">Transactions
on Robotics King-Sun Fu Best Paper Award</a>.  We are also proud to be part of
the <a href="https://www.climate-robotics.org/">Roadmap for Climate-Relevant
Robotics Research</a>, which outlines the future of robotics in addressing
climate change challenges.
